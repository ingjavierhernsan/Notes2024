Here we have included the Top Linux interview questions you can learn as a beginner, intermediate, or expert.

Beginner-Level Linux interview questions
The following 15 Linux interview questions are suitable for freshers because these questions will have basic information about Linux.

1.- What is Linux?
Linus Torvalds developed Linux, a Unix-like, free, open-source, and kernel operationg system. Mainly it is designed for systems, servers, embedded devices, mobile devices, and mainframes and is also supported in major computer platfroms such as ARM, xx86, and SPARC.

2.- Explain the basic features of the Linux OS.
Some basic fratures of Linux are:

- Linux is free and easily available.
- It is more secure than other operating systems because it uses security auditing and password authentication features.
- Linux has its personal software repository.
- It includes multiple languages throughout the world. Hence Linux supports different language keyboards.
- It offres CLI and GUI to use different commands and applications such as Firefox, VLC, etc.

3.- Name some Linux Distros.
There are various Linux distros but the following are the most commonly used:

- Ubuntu
- Debian
- CentOS
- Fedora
- RedHat

4.- What are the major differences between Linux and Windows?
The following table will help in understanding the difference between Linux and Windows:

Comparision  factor / Linux / Windows
Free/Paid / It is free and open-source OS. / It is not open-source and it free to use.
Security / Linux is highly secure. / Windows uses a backward slash between the directories.
Path separator / As a path seaparator, it uses a forward slash. / Windows uses a backward slash between the directories.
Efficiency / Linux is more efficient than Windows / Windows is less efficient.
Kernel type / It uses a monolithic kernel. / It uses a microkernel.
File system / Linux file systems are case-sensitive. / Its file system is case-insensitive.

5.- Define the basic components of Linux.
Majorly there are five basic components of Linux:

- Kernel: Linux kernel is a core part of the operating system that works as a bridge between hardware and software.
- Shell: Shell is an interface between a kernel and a user.
- GUI: Offers different way to interact with the system, known as the graphical user interface (GUI).
- Application programs: It is designed to perform a bundle of tasks through a bundle of functions.
- System utilities: It is the software functions through which users manage the system.

6.- Elaborate all the file permission in Linux.
There are three types of file permissions in Linux:

- Read: Users open and read files with this permissions.
- Write: Users can open and modify the files.
- Execute: Users can run the file.

7.- What is the Linux Kernel? Is it legal to edit it?
It is known as a low-level software system. The Linux kernel tracks the resources and provides a user interface. This OS is released under GPL (General public license). Hence every project is released under it. So, you can edit the Linux kernel legally.

8.- Explain LILO.
LILO, i. e., Linux loader and is a Linux boot loader. It loads the Linux operationg system into memory and starts teh execution. Most operating systems like Windows and macOS come with a bootloader. While in Linux, you need to install a separate booy loader, and LILO is one of the Linux boot loaders.

9.- What is Shell in Linux?
In Linux, five Shells are used:

- csh (C Shell): This shell offers job control and spell checking and is similar to C syntax.
- ksh (Korn Shell): A high-level shell for programming languages.
- ssh (Z Shell): This shell has an unique nature, such as closing comments, startup files, file name generating, and observing logout/login watching.
- bash (Bourne again shell): This is the default shell for Linux.
- Fish (Friendly interactive shell): This shell provides auto-suggestion, web-based configuration, etc.

10.- What is a root account?
The root is like the user's name or system adminsitrator account in Linux. The root account provides complete system control, which an ordinary user cannot do.

11.- Describe CLI and GUI in Linux.
CLI, i.e., command line interface. It takes input as a command and runs the tasks of the system. The term GUI refers to the Graphical User Interface or the human-computer interface. It uses icons, images, menus, and windows, which can be manipulated through the mouse.

12.- What is Swap Space?
Linux uses swap space to expand RAM. Linux uses this extra space to hold concurrently running programs termporarily.

13.- What is the difference between hard links and soft links?
Here isthe table that shows the difference berween soft links and hard links:

Hard links:
- Includes original content.
- Hard links are faster as compared to soft links.
- It shares similar inode numbers.
- There is no relative path for hard links.
- It didn't link the directories.
- Any change in this link reflects other files directly.
- It uses less memory.

Soft links:
- It includes the original file location.
- Soft links are slower.
- It shares different inode numbers.
- Relative paths are used for soft links.
- Every changes in this link reflects its hard link and the actual file directtly.
- It uses more memory.

14.- How do users create a symbolic link in Linux?
Symbolic links, symlink, or soft links are shortcuts to files and directories. Users can create the symbolic link in Linux through the 'ln' command. The general command to create a symbolic link is as follows:

ln -s <existing_source file> <optional_symbolic link>

15.- What do you understand about the standard streams?
Output and input in Linux OS are divided into three standard streams:

- stdin (standard input)
- stdout (standart output)
- stderr (standard error)

Under Linux, these standard streams channet communication of output and input between programs and their environment.

Intermediate-Level Linux interview questions
The next 15 questions are the best suitable for those who have and intermediate level of experience in Linux:

16.- How do you mount and unmount filesystem in Linux?
In this case, you can use the mount and umount commands.

For mounting:
- First, identify the partition through the fdisk -l command. You can also use the lsblk command for it.
- After identifying the parttion, create the directory which will work as the mount point. For example, running the mkdir /mnt/mountpnt will create the mountpnt directory as the mount point.
- Finally, you can run sudo mount <partition> <mount_point_directory> to complete the mounting.

For Unmounting:
Once you check if the specific filesystem is in use, you can run the sudo umount <mount_point_directory> for unmounting. If you want to learn more about the mount command in Linux, brief guide (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mount-command-in-linux-with-examples/).

17.- How do you troubleshoot network connectivity issues in Linux?
There are multiple ways to troubleshoot the network connectivity and find the issue correctly:

- Check the internet conectivity:
First of all, please check if the internet connection option is on and also check the cables to find if there is any issue with it.

- Verify the network configuration:
Please check that your network is configured correctly and the network interface has your IP address. You can check it by running the ip addr or ifconfig commands.
You can also run the ip route command to check if the default gateway is set properly.
Finally, verify the DNS server configuration in the /etc/resolv.cont file.

- Check the firewall:
Sometimes, firewall rules block the internet connection for the system's security. Hence, you can run the ufw or iptables command to modify the firewall rules.

- Network interface:
You can restart your network through the ifup and ifdown commands. Once you restart the network interface, please reboot the system to make changes successful.

18.- How do you list all the processes running in Linux?
You can list the currently running process in Linux through various commands such as:

- ps command:
Then ps command displays brief information about the running processes. You can use the ps -f of ps -e command because the -f option shows the full-format result, and the -e option displays all processes. Moreover, you can use the ps auxf vommand to get a detailed list of processes.

top and htop command:
The top command displays the real-time details about the system process and the complete resource usage.

The htop command is the improved version of the top command because it displays the color-coded list with additional features such as sorting, filtering, sorting, etc.

19.- What is the chmod command in Linux, and how do you use it?
You can use the chmod command to change the file permissions of the directories. It offers a simple way to control the read and write permissions. For instance, if you want to change the permission of the ABC.sh script and give it the write and executable permission, you can run the below command:

chmod u+wx ABX.sh

The chmod command is not limited to the write (w), read (r), and executable (x) permissions because there are symbolic modes and numeric modes, which you can learn from this guide.

20.- How do you check disk space usage?
There are some simple commands you can use to check disk space usage, such as:

df command:
The df or disk-free command shows the used and the available disk space. You can use the additional options to check disk the disk usage in the human-readable format.

du command:

The du or disk usage command estimates and shows the disk space usage, so running the du command with no option shows the disk usage of your current directory. However, you can run the following command to check the disk usage of a specific directory:

du -sh ~/<directory>

ncdu command:
The NCurses Disk Usage, or ncdu command, displays more interactive disk usage. Similar to the du command, the ncdu command also requires the path of the specific directory to check its space.

21.- How do you find the process ID (PID) of a running process?
You can use the following command to find the process ID or PID of the currently running process:

pgrep command:

The pgrep command shoes the PID of a process through its name or other different attributes. For example, you can find the PID of process_1 using the below command:

pgrep <process_1>

ps command:
ps command not only displays the currently running process but also shows the process's PID. However, if you want to check the PID of a specific process, you can combine the ps with the grep command:

ps -e | grep -i <process_1>

22.- What is the rsync command, and how do you use this command for synchronization?
The rsync command is used to synchronize and transfer the files in linux. It synchronizes files between two local systems, directories, or a network. The basic rsync command contains the following:

rsync <option> <source> <destination>

For example, let's  synchronize between Documents and the Downloads directory. For this, you need to run the following command:

rsync -av ~/Documents ~/Downloads

If you want to go one step further, then you can use the below command:

rsync -avz --delete ~/Documents ~/Downloads

In the above command:

- The -a option preserves all the permissions and other attributes.
- The -v option displays the detailed output of the synchronization.
- The -z allows compression that decreases the bandwidth use.
- The -delete option removes the file in the Downloads that do not exist in the Documents directory.

23.- How do you create a user account?
You can use adduser and useradd commands to create a user for the system.

useradd command:
Let's create a username, Ron, and provide a password for accession the system:

useradd Ron
passwd Ron

You can also explore the useradd command's additional options to modify the new user's permissions and privileges.

adduser command:

The adduser command is similar to the useradd command, so let's create a username Shawn:

adduser Shawn
passwd Shawn

24.- How do you format a disk in Linux?
The mkfs or make file system command helps format the disk in the Linux system. All you need to do is use the following method to format the disk:

Fist, run the lsblk command to lisk the available partitions and identify which disk you want to format.

If the selected disk is mounted, then unmount it through the following command:

umount <partition>

Now, find the file system type of the disk, like EXT4, NTFS, or XFS. Once you are done then, run one of the fillowing commands according to the file system type:

mkfs.ext4 <partition>
mkfs.xfs <partition>
mkfs.ntfs <partition>

Finally, mount the disk again through the mount command ofter the successful format. Moreover, please ensure that you have created a complete disk backup to eliminate the chances of data loss.

25.- How do you change the password for a user account?
Changing the password of a user account is simple because all you need to do is use the passwd command:

passwd username

For example, let's change the password of a user Ron through the velow command:

passwd Ron

Once you run the command, the system will ask you to enter and confirm the new password.

26.- What is the difference between a process and a thread?
In Linux, processes are the independent program, while a thread is the unit of execution. So here are the complete differences between process and thread:

= Process
+ Thread

Comparison factors
- Creation time
	= Creation time is higher.
	+ Creation time is less.
- Dependency
	= It is independent because it does not share memory.
	+ It depends on other threads because they share some memory with other threads.
- Resource
	= Resource use is higher.
	+ Requires lesser resources.
- Termination time
	= Ther termination time is higher.
	+ The termination time is less.

27.- What is the ulimit command, and how do you use it?
Tune ulimit command controls the resource limit for the user process. You can use the ulimit command to set the limit on the system resource to prevent consuming the higher resources. This command contains multiple options to set the limit. For example, youcan use the u option to set a macimum number of processes to 50:

ulimit -u 50

You can explore more options of the ulimit command by following this guide: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ulimit-soft-limits-and-hard-limits-in-linux/

28.- What is the find command, and how do you use it?
The find command searches for files based on different factors such as name, size, permissions, etc. Here is the basic command:

find <directory> <file>

For example, let's find a Linux.txt file located in the Downloads directory through the below command:

find ~/Downloads -name Linux.txt

Once you run the above command, the find command will start finding the Linux.txt in the Downloads directory and subdirectories.

29.- What is RAID in Linux?
The full form of RAID is the Redundant Array of Independent Disk that allows the system to combine the different physical disk drives into a logical unit. RAID is used to improve the system's disk performance and data integrity. There are different RAID levels you can configure according to the requirements. Here is the detainled information about the RAID levels:

RAID Levels:
RAID 0: It is called striping, which allows you to split the data into multiple disks without redundancy.
RAID 1: It is called mirroring, which allows you to create a complete copy of data on multiple disks.
RAID 5: It distributes the parity information and data on multiple disks.
RAID 6: It is the imporved version of RAID 5 as it uses two sets of parity infromation to provide higher data redundancy
RAID 10: It comvines RAID 0 and RAID 1 to generate the set of mirror disks to improve performance and redundancy. 

30.- What are the challenges of using Linux?
There are numerous challenges that a user faces while using Linux:
- Linux shows hardware compatibility issues in certain devices because manufacturers prioritize Windoes compatibility.
- Learning Linux is not easy because the configuration and commands require proper knowledge.
- Although Linux supports Steam, it still needs to be impressed regarding game compatibility and availability.
- Sometimes users face driver and firmware-related issues.

Advanced-Level Linux intervie questions
These 15 questions will revolve around your experience and help you in preparing for the advanced-level Linux interview:

31.- What is the /proc file system?
/proc (Proc file System) is the virtual file system that shows ingormation about the system and the Kernel data structures. It is the essential interface to acess the system, perform debugging tasks, check the kernel functioning, fing process-related information, and many more.

Therefore, you can use /proc file system in Linux to get information about the system and mofigy the particular Kernel parameters at the runtime.

32.- How do you secure a Linux server?
There are multiple methods to secure the Linux server and protect it from data breaches, security threats, and unauthorized access. Here are some of these methods:

- Create a strong password.
- Update the server and apply security patches.
- use secured protocols like SSH and configure it to use key-based authentication for higher security.
- Use the intrusion detection system (IDS) to monitor network traffic and prevent malicious activities.\
- Configure the firewall to limit the inbound and outbound traffic on the server.
- Disable all unused network services.
- Create regular backups.
- Review logs and perform regular security audits.
- Encrypt network traffic and enable monitoring.

33.- What is strace command?
The stace command is the diagnostic utility by which you can trace and monitor the system calls generated by teh process. It allows you to find how programs interact with Kernel and can be used for debugging and troubleshooting. For example, let's find the system calls generated by the ls command:

strace ls

Once you run the above command, the system will start tracing the list command and show the system calls generated by it. Output from the above command includes information like call name, argument, and return values.
