5.- Define the basic components of Linux.
Majorly there are five basic components of Linux:

- Kernel: Linux kernel is a core part of the operating system that works as a bridge between hardware and software.
- Shell: Shell is an interface between a kernel and a user.
- GUI: Offers different way to interact with the system, known as the graphical user interface (GUI).
- Application programs: It is designed to perform a bundle of tasks through a bundle of functions.

9.- What is Shell in Linux?
In Linux, five Shells are used:

- csh (C Shell): This shell offers job control and spell checking and is similar to C syntax.
- ksh (Korn Shell): A high-level shell for programming languages.
- ssh (Z Shell): This shell has an unique nature, such as closing comments, startup files, file name generating, and observing logout/login watching.
- bash (Bourne again shell): This is the default shell for Linux.
- Fish (Friendly interactive shell): This shell provides auto-suggestion, web-based configuration, etc.
